# Window Sights

An open list of things worth seeing out of an airplane window: mountains, volcanoes, glaciers, lakes, canyons, coastlines, parks and skylines. Each one is rated 1 to 10 for how good it looks from a passenger window.

It powers Window, an app that tells you which side of the plane to sit on.

## The data

`data/sights.csv` is the source of truth: 4,639 sights, one per row.

| column | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Display name. Group a cluster as one sight when you'd see it as one ("Eiger / Jungfrau"). |
| `lat`, `lon` | Decimal degrees, the point a passenger would look at. |
| `kind` | One of `peak`, `range`, `volcano`, `glacier`, `lake`, `coast`, `canyon`, `island`, `park`, `desert`, `landmark`, `feature`, `city`. |
| `rating` | 1 to 10. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the scale. |
| `region` | US state, Canadian province, Australian state, or country. |

`data/sights.geojson` is the same list as points, so you can browse it on a map right here on GitHub.

## Where it came from

- **Wikidata**: peaks ranked by prominence, volcanoes, national parks, large lakes, glaciers, canyons and fjords. Wikidata is CC0.
- **Natural Earth**: state and country boundaries for the `region` column. Public domain.
- **Hand curation**: a starter list of famous sights, skyline ratings for cities (by count of 150 m+ towers, not population), and many rating fixes.

`scripts/seed/` holds the scripts that built the first version from those sources. They're kept for reference. From here on, edit the CSV directly.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome: new sights, better coordinates, rating changes with a reason. Every change runs `scripts/validate.py` automatically. Details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
